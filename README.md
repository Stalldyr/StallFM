# StallFM

About: This script sorts Last.fm library by the original release year in which the track was published. The cleaner the tags on Last.fm, the better it works. I recommend using RudeySH's [lastfm-bulk-edit](https://github.com/RudeySH/lastfm-bulk-edit) to fix the tags of the users top albums, though this is a tedious process. I'm working on possibly find a way of auto-tagging albums, so that this step can be skipped. 

Instructions:
* This branch of pylast needs to be used in order for it to work correctly: https://github.com/Stalldyr/pylast/tree/pylast-with-releaseyear
* Download the uses Last.fm library csv from https://benjaminbenben.com/lastfm-to-csv/ and place it to the same folder as StallFM.py
